Also unlike other virtual assistant apps, we've made the CallMom knowledge base completely open source. Hosted on a Google Code project, the CallMom AIML is freely available to anyone wishing to create his own custom CallMom personality.

The second sentence is then linked to the first one, except if the second sentence reminds her something else, in which case Harumi will link the first sentence to it. With time, this simple algorithm produces good results. Harumi will tend to have your personnality. Nevertheless, Harumi was not only built as a chat experiment for turing test. From the beginning of the development, Harumi is a usefull program :  You can ask her for your appointments, phone numbers, adress, internet url, files repertory.... all of those informations are stocked in its mind, a file called memory.ods You can ask her to translate words from english to french, or to seach for a file on a drive. It is possible for her to remind you things you have to do, or to record your feelings and randomly remind you sentences linked to your bad or good mood. She's able to execute a program, to give you your ip and emac adress or to calculate an operation. As you can see, many windows functions can be replaced by Harumi.","French, English",http://jeffelson.e-monsite.com/,http://www.chatterbotcollection.com/item_display.php?id=3106,2011,,

Hollaka Hollala,http://www.chatterbotcollection.com/images/hollala_1365078969.jpg,"IRC bot. Hollaka Hollala is a chatbot engine and IRC bot written in Java. The chatbot engine uses a knowledge base organized in an XML file and WordNet for dictionary lookup. The IRC Bot has some WordNet- and some Web-based functionality and is hot-extensible through Ruby programs (new commands and functionality can be defined in Ruby scripts which are loaded at runtime. Hollaka Hollala is a learning chatbot engine and IRC bot. The chatbot engine uses XML (using JDOM) to store the knowledge base and WordNet (using JWNL) as an external resource. The knowledge base is organized in topics, which consist of keywords and possible answers. These are organized in a simple XML format. The program tries to find the most suitable topic for a user input (e.g. using semantic relations from WordNet and word counting). On the selected topic the answer is then chosen randomly, where answers with higher frequencies (meaning things often said by users) occur more often. This is a place for possible extensions (e.g. speech act theory, pragmatics in general, any comparison between possible answers and input). When no suitable topic is found new topics are made up from the user input, using information from WordNet and the user input for initial content. The chatbot can therefore start with an empty knowledge base and learn new topics and answers for these topics from user conversation.",English,http://hollala.sourceforge.net/,http://www.chatterbotcollection.com/item_display.php?id=952,2008,,

NARS,,"""NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System) is a general-purpose reasoning system, coming from my study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cognitive Sciences (CogSci). What makes NARS different from conventional reasoning systems is its ability to learn from its experience and to work with insufficient knowledge and resources. NARS attempts to uniformly explain and reproduce many cognitive facilities, including reasoning, learning, planning, reacting, perceiving, categorizing, prioritizing, remembering, decision making, and so on.""",English,https://sites.google.com/site/narswang/,http://www.chatterbotcollection.com/item_display.php?id=1185,2008,,

The ProgramPY-SH engine is written in Python3.x and BASH. All chatterbots that run on the ProgramPY-SH engine are known as Betabots.

The personality transfer software had been recently upgraded, but, as it turned out, the upgrade had a few flaws. The result was an incomplete transfer of memories from the model host. This has led to emotional instability and at times a schism between the original host persona and the underlying basic personality matrix. The replicant had been originally intended for use as a terraform engineer, but to conceal its instability the Corporation repurposed her as a student working as a waitress in their Polynesian history museum. They figured no one would notice any issues.
